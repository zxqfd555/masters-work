              Trippie Redd  has been feuding with his former collaborator  6ix9ine  for over a year now, but the Ohio rapper still holds the few songs they made together in high regard. During an Instagram Live session with DJ Akademiks over the weekend, Trippie called his duo with 6ix9ine the “greatest of all time” and said it was bigger than the late  XXXTentacion  and  Ski Mask The Slump God .                  Akademiks Exclusive: On our Instagram live. #trippieredd stated that him and #tekashi69 are the best duo even more than #xxxtentacion and #skimasktheslumpgod . FAXXX or FICTION!! Via @iamakademiks   A post shared by   DJ Akademiks  (@akadmiks) on  Aug 12, 2018 at 9:24pm PDT           “They couldn’t make timeless music with the same screaming and yelling at the same time,” Trippie explained. “I feel like X was just timeless on his own part and Ski had his own thing going on.”    In 2017, 6ix9ine appeared on Trippie’s songs  “Poles1469”  and  “Owee.”  However, Trippie  denounced the Brooklyn rapper  that August after finding out that 6ix9ine  pled guilty to one felony count  of  Use of a Child in a Sexual Performance  when he was 18 years old. The two rappers have been beefing since then, with  some incidents even turning to violence .    6ix9ine is currently scheduled for court on Oct. 2 after violating his 2015 plea deal. According to  BBC , the Manhattan District Attorney’s office is recommending that he be tried as an adult, and he is facing a sentence of up to three years in prison. The office also wants him to be registered as a sex offender.    XXXTentacion and Ski Mask co-founded the South Florida collective  Members Only  in 2015 and released a trio of self-titled mixtapes as part of the group. They also frequently appeared on each other’s songs, such as Ski Mask’s  “RIP Roach”  and XXX’s  “ILoveItWhenTheyRun.”    It’s worth noting that Trippie and XXXTentacion had a turbulent relationship while the Florida rapper was still alive, but it’s apparent that the death made a profound impact. Trippie  revealed it was his birthday  on the date of XXX’s passing, and also  dyed his hair in tribute  to the Florida rapper.    In June, Trippie Redd dropped his posthumous XXXTentacion collaboration  “Ghost Busters,”  which also features Ski Mask vowing to find revenge for his friend’s murder.
